# JavaScript Countries App
The app uses the Vue.js JavaScript framework and the restcountries.eu API to carry out the following:
* Display the total population of all countries the API provides
* Use a drop down to allow the user to select a single country and display information about it.
* Allow users to add their favourite countries to a list that is also displayed in the app.
